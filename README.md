This is the site that I wrote the source for my client!

# 🌱 : Simurgh WebSite
Well, Simorgh is an unofficial institution that does different things, I don't think any further explanation is necessary!

## ✨: What I give you!
I tried to provide you with everything you need for your site!
I presented you a website system with two subdomains; In addition to increasing user satisfaction, this also makes your work easier!
This website is fully responsive and can be seen in the same way on any device!

## 💥 : How do I use it?
Proceed as follows:
* Step 1 : Purchase suitable hosting from a reputable company in your country (generally, 1 gig of RAM is required for each subdomain).
* Step 2: After that, log in to your host
* Step 3: Upload your site's source in it.
* Step 4: Connect each part of your site to a subdomain.
* Step 5: Edit your information in the "block.htaccess" file.
* Step 6: Enjoy your website 😍.
